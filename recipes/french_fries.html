    <ul>
        <li>4 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into sticks</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a deep fryer or large pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Rinse the potato sticks in cold water to remove excess starch. Pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.</li>

        <li>Remove fries from the oil and drain on paper towels. Season with salt immediately.</li>
